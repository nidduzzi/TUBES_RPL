This project leverages [oas3-tools](https://github.com/bug-hunters/oas3-tools), a fork of the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

### Contributing

- Implement bussiness logic in `/services`.  
- Use middlewares by modifying to the options object in `server.js`. according to [express-openapi-validator](https://github.com/cdimascio/express-openapi-validator#readme) syntax and store them in `/middlewares`.  
- Database models are stored in `/models`, use the `require()` syntax to import them into the service files that need them.
